# Predicting Song Genres with Audio Features

This is a project to see if it's possible to predict the genres of songs based on their audio characteristics. Overall, the techinques deployed were able to achieve a reasonable accuracy. The best model, Random Forest, achieved about 66% accuracy. 

## Notebooks
- predict_genre_2.0.ipynb
This is the final version with four classification models. It requires a csv file labeled audio_features_5.3_clean.csv, which is stored in the data directory. After the initial model training, a few visualizations are provided to see how the models performed and suggest directions for future modeling work.

- track_modeling.ipynb
This notebook contains the initial attempt to use supervised learning techniques to predict song genre. It requires a csv file labeled audio_features_5.3_clean.csv, which is stored in the data directory.

- get_song_stats.ipynb
This notebook contains to code for downloading the relevant data from the Spotify Web API, which is a lengthy process. You can acquire your own client_id and client_secret from Spotify's developer portal (requires sign-up). It stores the downloaded data in a SQLite db file in the same directory, and provides code for exporting that file to csv, which is needed for the data cleaning notebook.

- get_popularity.ipynb
This is a supplementary notebook to get the popularity rating for Spotify tracks. (This was an exploratory step in the project that was added later.) If you want to run this notebook, you'll need the SQLite db file generated by running get_song_stats.

- track_cleaning.ipynb
This notebook shows the data cleaning proccess and documents the choices that were made. It takes the audio_features_5.3.csv file generated by get_song_stats, and outputs a csv file called audio_features_5.3_clean.csv.

## Data files

The aforementioned csv files, which can be used to run predict_genres_2.0, can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TuFB7aulLAO7h-1AaNkSyQ8URar3xeED?usp=sharing).

- audio_features_5.3.csv

## Visualizations

### Genres to predict

Here are the top 10 most represented genres in our dataset. We'll be using these 10 as the classes for our prediction task.

### Feature distribution

This graph shows the distribution of the different audio features provided by Spotify.

### Term Frequency & Inverse Document Frequency -> Top 10 tokens by genre

Note: only English stopwords were removed, on the theory that Spanish and French stopwords might provide useful information to help separate out non-Anglophone genres.
