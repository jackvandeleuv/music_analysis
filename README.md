# Predicting Song Genres with Audio Features

This is a project to see if it's possible to predict the genres of songs based on their audio characteristics. 

## Notebooks
- track_modeling
This notebook performs supervised learning techniques in an attempt to predict song genre. It requires a csv file labeled audio_features_4.0_clean.csv, which is stored in the data directory. After the initial model training, a few visualizations are provided to see how the models performed and suggest directions for future modeling work.

- get_song_stats
This notebook contains to code for downloading the relevant data from the Spotify Web API, which is a lengthy process. You can acquire your own client_id and client_secret from Spotify's developer portal (requires sign-up). It stores the downloaded data in a SQLite db file in the same directory, and provides code for exporting that file to csv, which is needed for the data cleaning notebook.

- get_popularity
This is a supplementary notebook to get the popularity rating for Spotify tracks. (This was an exploratory step in the project that was added later.) If you want to run this notebook, you'll need the SQLite db file generated by running get_song_stats.

- track_cleaning
This notebook shows the data cleaning proccess and documents the choices that were made. It takes the audio_features_4.0.csv file generated by get_song_stats, and outputs a csv file called audio_features_4.0_clean.csv.
